# Odyssey Voyage II - Client (Airlock)

Welcome to the companion app of Odyssey's Voyage II: Federating the Monolith! This is the `client` frontend of the Airlock app. You can [find the course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](http://odyssey.apollographql.com/voyage-part2), Apollo's learning platform.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](https://odyssey-airlock.netlify.app/).

You can [find the server counterpart here](https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-voyage-II-server).

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you through step by step how to turn the _backend_ from a monolithic graph into a federated graph. It focuses on backend only, so you won't be making any changes to this frontend codebase. You can use this client app to send queries to the graph.

To get started:

1. In a terminal window, run `npm install`.
1. Then, run `npm start`.

This will open up a new browser tab to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You will need the [back-end server](https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-voyage-II-server) running on `localhost:4000` for any queries to work.
